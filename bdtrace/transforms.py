"""Registry of the repo's representation transformations, CLI-applicable.

Each entry wraps one extractor from representations/ so `bdtrace transform`
can enumerate them, apply one, or apply all to a JSONL of records. Two record
shapes exist: "trace" transforms take a whole trace dict (an `events` list),
"patch" transforms take before/after source fields. Imports are lazy so
listing costs nothing and LLM deps load only when an inferred transform runs.

The privacy operators in bdtrace/privacy.py live in the same registry with two
more shapes. "rewrite": the record goes in and the same record comes out with
one field type changed, nothing is added under `reprs`. "corpus": the same,
after one pass over the whole input builds the operator (min_users needs the
per-value developer counts before it can rewrite anything). They carry a `family`
(the privacy family they belong to), take their parameters explicitly
(`--param k=v`, typed from the operator's own signature), and are excluded from
`all` because each one destroys information and several need a salt.
